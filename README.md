# Regression, Classification, and Forecasting projects 
**Main target: learn how to work with tabular data and deal with different kinds of problems**  
Everything I learned from the kaggle courses, and dozens of community notebooks. **References are in the code.**

## 1. Regression problem: [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/overview)
Target: Using information from the training dataset, you must predict house prices for the testing dataset. 

## 2. Classification problem: [Heart Failure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
Target: Predict heart failure, using dataset.

## 3. Forecasting problem: [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview)
Target: Forecast 16 days of sales for 54 stores for each of 32 product families, using 6 datasets.    
[!] Github can't handle files larger than 25 Mb, so you need to [download](https://www.kaggle.com/c/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data) datasets from the competition page, before running the code.
